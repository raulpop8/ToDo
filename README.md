<p align="center">one simple and effective todo list; just open it asside and quickly write down things you have to do.</p>

So this was a simple project I did, and also one of my favorite (simple) project I've done.
I've been following some YouTube tutorials and then tried my best to replicate one of those web apps.

You can see the project live here: <a href="https://raulpop.ro/projects/todo/" target=_blank>ToDo</a>

<h2>Updates?</h2>
There probably will be minor changes for this project. As I learn new things and get more confortable with writing my own code, I'll definitely change thinks around.
